# Free URL shortner

## Simple and responsive design.

This is one of my project that I created with Nodejs..
Built with

- HTML
- CSS (Scss Pre processor)
- JavaScript (This project 90% depends on JavaScript)
- Ejs (I used Ejs as a template engine for this project)
- MongoDb (I used mongoose for connect to mongoDb)
- NodeJs as backend (express framework)

## Features

- Responsive Design (looks beautiful for all screens)
- Contains [Global-Setting file] (You can controll any part of website from this file..)
- Beautiful alerts (powered by SweetAlert2)
- Ads, I created 3 Places for banner Ads. You can turn them On or Off from [Global-settings file].
- Some animations
- Basic security.
